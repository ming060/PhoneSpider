## Why
The website [DeviceSpecifications](https://www.devicespecifications.com/en) is a very useful tool when you want to check phone specs. You can input model name to search the phone spec with its search box.
For example, I want to seach Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017). I know the model alias is A520, so I cant find it by the alias name.

But, sometimes it doesn't work!!! If I just know the alias name is 520 (Sometimes they just don't put the whole name on the back of the phone), then I would fail to search the correct phone.

I'm not sure how the website implement the search function. But in this case, I have to enter the model name or model alias from the beginning to make the searching success.
